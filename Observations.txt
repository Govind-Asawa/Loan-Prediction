Univariate Analysis :- 

    This is intended to understand each variable/feature independently. This is usually done using plots,
    for 
        a) Continuous :- Histograms, boxplots
        b) Categorical :- count plot
    
    Continuous :- 

        1)ApplicantIncome :- 0 nulls, Right Skewed, Lot outliners
        2)CoapplicantIncome :- 0 nulls, Right Skewed, some outliners
        3)LoanAmount :- 22 nulls,quite well distributed
        4)Loan_Amount_Term :- 14 nulls, single high value (around 380)
    
    Categorical :-
        
        1)Gender :- data has 81% Male
        2)Married :- 65% Applicants are Married
        3)Dependents :-  57% of Applicants do not have any dependents, 
                        10% have 1 ,another 10% have 2 dependents
        4)Education :- 80% of the Applicants are Graduates
        5)Self_Employed :- just 15%
        6)Property_Area :- Almost no bias
        7)Loan_Status :- 69% of the Applicants have got their loan sanctioned

Bivariate Analysis :-
    
    Categorical Vs Target:

        1)Gender :- Nothing significant, plot shows that the final result is not biased based on gender
        2)Self_Employed :- Nothing significant
        3)Married :- Married Applicants MAY have 10% higher chance of getting loan
        4)Education :- Same as Married 
        5)Credit_History :- It seems people with credit history as 1 are more likely to get their loans approved (80%of them get loan approved).
    
    Continuous Vs Target:
        1)Applicant & CoApplicant Income :- Even after looking at each quartile separately, Income doesn't seem to impact Loan_Status individually,
                            which is quite counter intuitive

                            But when we combine both we find that the ppl below a combined Income of 2800 are less likely to get loan
        2)Loan_Amount_Term :- higher Loan_Amount_Term seems less likely to get loan
