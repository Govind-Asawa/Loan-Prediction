Target: Loan_Status (Categorical)

Continuous (4) :- 
    ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term

Categorical (8) :-
    Nominal :- Gender, Married, Self_Employed, Credit_History, Loan_Status(Target)
    Ordinal :- Dependents, Property_Area, Education

Univariate Analysis :- 

    This is intended to understand each variable/feature independently. This is usually done using plots,
    for 
        a) Continuous :- Histograms, boxplots
        b) Categorical :- count plot
    
    Continuous :- 

        1)ApplicantIncome :- 0 nulls, Right Skewed, Lot outliners
        2)CoapplicantIncome :- 0 nulls, Right Skewed, some outliners
        3)LoanAmount :- 22 nulls,quite well distributed
        4)Loan_Amount_Term :- 14 nulls, single high value (around 380)
    
    Categorical :-
        
        1)Gender :- data has 81% Male, (13 nulls)
        2)Married :- 65% Applicants are Married, (3 nulls)
        3)Dependents :-  57% of Applicants do not have any dependents, 
                        10% have 1 ,another 10% have 2 dependents (15 nulls)
        4)Education :- 80% of the Applicants are Graduates
        5)Self_Employed :- just 15%, (32 nulls)
        6)Property_Area :- Almost no bias
        7)Loan_Status :- 69% of the Applicants have got their loan sanctioned

Bivariate Analysis :-
    
    Categorical Vs Target:

        1)Gender :- Nothing significant, plot shows that the final result is not biased based on gender
        2)Self_Employed :- Nothing significant
        3)Married :- Married Applicants MAY have 10% higher chance of getting loan
        4)Education :- Same as Married 
        5)Credit_History :- It seems people with credit history as 1 are more likely to get their loans approved (80%of them get loan approved).
    
    Continuous Vs Target:
        1)Applicant & CoApplicant Income :- Even after looking at each quartile separately, Income doesn't seem to impact Loan_Status individually,
                            which is quite counter intuitive

                            But when we combine both we find that the ppl below a combined Income of 2800 are less likely to get loan
        2)Loan_Amount_Term :- higher Loan_Amount_Term seems less likely to get loan

Iteration 1:

    Used all Categorical variables except - [Gender, Self_Employed, Education]
    ROC - AUC : 0.84
    Precision - Recall curve: AUC :0.71
    applied basic Munging

Iteration 2:
    not much different from Iteration - 1
    but just added a imputation to Credit_History based on 
        -- TotalIncome (ApplicantIncome + CoapplicantIncome)
        -- Dependents
        -- Property_Area
    
    Also found that - ROC was a misleading statistic since it doesn't consider imbalance b/w the classes
    instead 
    Precision - Recall curve turned out to be a good measure
        as it says how good are we classifying the minority class correctly

    Finally --- The result:
    It did not have a significant Impact but could lift accuracy from 0.777 to 0.78

Iteration 3:
    applied Decision Tree classifier
    Seemed promising but pulled down my accuracy to 0.69 ( -_- )
